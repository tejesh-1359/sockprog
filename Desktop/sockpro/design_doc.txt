readme

To run the project:

Download the repository
and compile it using

          make -f makefile.mk normal
          
 Steps:
 
 1. use ./myserver to launch the server
 2. use ./myclient to launch the client ----  multiple clients can be launched





Things not done:

1.The ip table craeted has the port numbers...The entries should actually be changed to New host ip and subnet mask etc.
2.The server updating the other clients of its data but not the data coming from the other clients -- not fixed this issue.
